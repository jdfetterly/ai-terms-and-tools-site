# **App Name**: AI Lexicon

## Core Features:

- Term Definition Display: Display AI terminology definitions in a clear, markdown format.
- Interactive Tool Embedding: Embed interactive tools via iFrames, allowing users to interact directly with external resources on the website.
- Term Navigation: Navigation to browse AI terms alphabetically or by category.
- Term Search: Implement a search functionality to quickly find specific AI terms or concepts.
- AI-Powered Example Generation: Utilize an AI "tool" to generate usage examples of the definitions, when one is not explicitly present in the input data, but the user requests it. The AI "tool" should reason about which AI usage context is most relevant and then create a definition to that usage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) - RGB(33, 150, 243). A vibrant blue to convey intelligence and clarity.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) - RGB(242, 246, 249). A very light blue to maintain focus on the definitions.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) - RGB(25, 158, 168). A teal tone, for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable interface.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets within definitions.
- Use a consistent set of outline icons to visually represent categories and related concepts. Icons should be simple and easily understandable.
- Implement a clean and intuitive layout that is easy to navigate. Utilize white space effectively to avoid clutter.
