This could lead to an "[intelligence explosion](https://www.forethought.org/research/three-types-of-intelligence-explosion)" where the ASI rapidly improves itself, creating an even more powerful intelligence. This concept raises significant ethical and control challenges, often debated in the context of existential risk and the future of humanity.',

It then uses the model\'s own intelligence to evaluate the progress and coherence of each "thought branch," allowing it to discard dead-end ideas and pursue more promising lines of reasoning. This deliberative process makes it more robust for problems requiring complex planning, strategy, or exploration.',
