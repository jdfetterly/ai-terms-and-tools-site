## Example Entry

### Basic Details
- **Term Name**: "Transformer Architecture"
- **Category**: "AI Architectures & Capabilities"
- **Action**: NEW

### Content Sections

#### Simple Definition
```
A neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of data, forming the foundation of modern large language models like GPT and BERT.
```

#### Analogy
```
Like a highly efficient editor who can instantly focus on any part of a document while understanding how each sentence relates to every other sentence, rather than reading linearly from start to finish.
```

#### Example
```
GPT-4, BERT, and T5 are all built on the Transformer architecture, enabling them to understand context and generate coherent text.
```

#### Detailed Definition
```
The Transformer architecture, introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, revolutionized natural language processing by replacing recurrent neural networks with self-attention mechanisms. This allows for parallel processing of sequences and better capture of long-range dependencies in data.
```

#### Why it Matters
```
Transformers enabled the breakthrough performance of modern AI systems, making possible the large language models that power ChatGPT, Google Bard, and other conversational AI tools that are transforming how we interact with technology.
```

### Interactive Tools
